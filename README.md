# Biopython
This repo will likely in the future have several different python programs that utilize Biopython. The list included will update accordingly.

1) primerDesign v0.0.2- Package designed to look for an open frame in a target protein nucleotide sequence, and determine a possible restriction enzyme site in a target vector for transformation. Current testing is being done using a pET-32 a,b,c(+) vector, found from Novagen (sequence found at http://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/product/pET-32a+-DNA-Novagen,EMD_BIO-69015).
